# Milestone 9 â€” Compliance Hub

## Scope

Add /console/compliance with IEEE, Red Hat, SOC2, and NIST mappings. Show live pass/fail signals from pipeline.

## Objectives

- Mappings visible and navigable
- Signals reflect CI outcomes
- Links to evidence and reports

## Acceptance Criteria

- CI writes a summary JSON used by UI
- Drill-down to markdown docs

## Tasks

- [ ] Create compliance summary JSON in CI
- [ ] Build /console/compliance page
- [ ] Link to COMPLIANCE.md and reports

## Evidence

- Screenshots, CI artifacts

## Validation

- Signals match real pipeline statuses

## Risks

- Misalignment between CI and UI; keep schema versioned

## Status

- not-started

## Dates
