# Milestone 8 — Contracts & Token Flow

## Scope

Scaffold ERC-721/4626 contracts. Map vault metadata → token minting + treasury snapshots.

## Objectives

- Contracts compile and deploy to testnet
- Metadata aligns with vault records
- Treasury snapshots generated

## Acceptance Criteria

- Hardhat project compiles
- Deploy script runs on Sepolia
- Mint flow tested with pinned metadata

## Tasks

- [ ] Add contracts and Hardhat scaffold
- [ ] Configure testnet deployment
- [ ] Wire mint flow in UI or script

## Evidence

- Transaction links, deployment logs

## Validation

- Contract addresses recorded and reachable

## Risks

- Gas spikes; use testnets and caps during testing

## Status

- not-started
